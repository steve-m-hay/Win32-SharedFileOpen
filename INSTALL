INSTALLATION

    To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this INSTALL file
    and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
        nmake test
        nmake install

    Use "dmake" rather than "nmake" in the commands above if that is what your
    Perl was built with.  To determine which make program was used to build your
    Perl type the following:

        perl -V:make

PREREQUISITES

    This module only works on "native" (i.e. non-Cygwin) Microsoft Windows
    platforms since only those platforms have C runtime libraries that contain
    the functions which this module provides interfaces to.

    Perl version 5.6.0 or later.

    The only non-standard Perl module required by this module is:

        Win32::WinError

    This is part of the "libwin32" distribution, which is almost invariably
    present in Perl installations on Microsoft Windows platforms anyway, and is
    available from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/).
