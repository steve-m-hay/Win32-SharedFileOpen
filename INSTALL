PREREQUISITES

    Microsoft Windows

        This module only works on "native" (i.e. non-Cygwin) Microsoft Windows.
        (Nothing else has the functions which this module provides emulations of
        anyway.)

    C Compiler

        You need a C compiler to build this module.

        Ideally you should try to use the same compiler as was used to build
        your perl itself, although this is not essential.  (However, there is a
        known compatibility problem when building this module with Visual Studio
        .NET 2002/2003 (VC7) or earlier if your perl was built with Visual
        Studio 2005 (VC8) or later: see [perl #121448].)

    Perl

        Perl version 5.8.1 or later.
        The latest version of Perl is available from http://www.perl.com/.

    Perl Modules

        The only non-standard Perl module required by this module is

            Win32::WinError

        which is available from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/).

INSTALLATION

    To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this INSTALL file
    and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
        nmake test
        nmake install

    Use "dmake" rather than "nmake" in the commands above if that is what your
    perl was built with.  To determine which make program was used to build your
    perl type the following:

        perl -V:make
