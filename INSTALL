INSTALLATION

    To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this INSTALL file
    and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
        nmake test
        nmake install

PREREQUISITES

    Perl version 5.6.0 or later.

    The only non-standard module required by this module is:

        Win32::WinError

    This is part of the "libwin32" distribution, which is almost invariably
    present in Perl installations on Microsoft Windows platforms anyway, and is
    available from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/).

    Obviously this module only works on Microsoft Windows platforms, and
    requires Microsoft Visual C to build it since other C libraries presumably
    do not implement the Microsoft-specific functions which this module provides
    wrappers to.
