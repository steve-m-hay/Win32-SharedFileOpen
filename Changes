Revision history for Perl extension Win32::SharedFileOpen.
_________________

v2.12 05 Sep 2002

	- Fixes for Perl Version 5.8.0:

	  * Explicitly quoted Win32::WinError in Makefile.PL otherwise it now dies
	    with an error about 'Bareword not allowed while "strict subs" in use';

	  * Explicitly put fdopen()'d Perl filehandle into binary mode because it no
	    longer inherits this mode from the C filehandle opened in the XS.

	- Removed use() of AutoLoader since no use was being made of it.

	- Improved definition of @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS.

	- Corrected documentation typos in the README and the POD.
_________________

v2.11 02 Jul 2002

	- Imported the INFINITE flag from <winbase.h> like other Win32 modules do,
	  rather than defining our own constant, to avoid clashes with them.

	- Added $Max_Time as a better means than $Max_Tries of controlling when to
	  give up retrying when a file can't be opened due to a sharing violation.

	- Allowed the tie()'d variables to have the undefined value: this is
	  necessary because local()'ising a tie()'d variable currently leaves it
	  tie()'d but initially undefined. It is also useful anyway to indicate the
	  variable is not in use.

	- Updated documentation for these changes.
_________________

v2.10 20 Jun 2002

	- Implemented the "First-Class Filehandle Trick" in the function new_fh(),
	  and re-exported the function gensym() from the Symbol module, for
	  convenience.

	- Added $Max_Tries, $Retry_Timeout and INFINITE so that the file open can be
	  retried if it failed due to a sharing violation.

	- Updated documentation for these changes.

	- Local()'ised the changes made to $! within AUTOLOAD() as per Perl Bug ID
	  20020614.002: see http://bugs.perl.org/ for more details.
_________________

v2.00 27 May 2002

	- Changed arguments and return values of fsopen() and sopen() to require a
	  "filehandle" argument and simply return a boolean, rather than returning
	  the filehandle opened.

	- Updated documentation to reflect the changes made to fsopen() and sopen()
	  and to document a serious flaw in fsopen() :-(

	- Minor cosmetic changes.
