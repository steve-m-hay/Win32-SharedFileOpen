                      Win32::SharedFileOpen, Version 3.16
________________________________________________________________________________

Revision history for Perl extension Win32::SharedFileOpen.
_________________

v3.16 21 Feb 2004

    - Separated the two debug modes into a more traditional Boolean debug mode
      emitting warnings about function failures, plus a new Boolean trace mode
      which emits the information regarding what fsopen() and sopen() did.

      This is a change in behaviour, but should only affect users investigating
      errors; it should not affect any production systems.

    - Clarified licence and warranty for the module, and included relevant
      licence files in the distribution.

    - Moved installation instructions to a separate INSTALL file.

    - Added PREOP to the dist option in Makefile.PL to ensure permissions are
      set correctly within the distdir (since they often aren't set correctly in
      the top-level directory when working on Windows) to stop CPANTS from
      complaining about bad permissions.

    - Added COMPRESS (and SUFFIX) and ZIPFLAGS to the dist option in Makefile.PL
      to enable "best compression" for gzip when running "nmake dist" and for
      zip when running "nmake zipdist" respectively.

    - Added clean option to Makefile.PL to have the const-c.inc and const-xs.inc
      files deleted by "nmake clean".

    - Added MANIFEST.SKIP to stop "nmake distcheck" from producing bogus
      warnings.

    - Moved SharedFileOpen.pm into lib/Win32/ sub-directory within distribution.
      This is the new layout style produced by h2xs as of version 1.23.

    - Removed ppport.h since no use was being made of it.  (This module contains
      its own portability fixups in order to build on Perl installations back to
      5.6.0, both with and without ithreads.)
_________________

v3.15 24 Sep 2003

    - Changed the output of debug information to use warn() rather than simply
      print()'ing to STDERR to enable the information to be captured by a
      $SIG{__WARN__} handler if required.

    - Added two tests to exercise the debug output with $Debug to set 2.

    - Renamed some functions in the XS and C code.

    - Reverted the typemap for "const char *" back to the default T_PV.  There
      didn't seem to be any point in the custom typemap.

    - Changed tabs to spaces (via "expand -t 4 infile > outfile") to avoid
      irritation when switching between editors that use 4- or 8-space tabs.

    - Changed control-E to caret-E in extended OS error variable name to make
      files "eight bit clean".

    - Updated META.yml via ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.17.
_________________

v3.14 31 Jul 2003

    - Preload some ERROR_* constants that our use()'rs might need otherwise the
      value of $^E gets interfered with when they are autoloaded by
      Win32::WinError in libwin32-0.191 and earlier when using debug builds of
      Perl.

    - Added META.yml (courtesy of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.11).
_________________

v3.13 28 May 2003

    - Regenerated constant() and AUTOLOAD() using h2xs 1.22 with options:
      -n Win32::SharedFileOpen -b 5.6.0
      to change to new constant loading system.

    - Added new constant, O_RAW, which is an alias for O_BINARY.

    - Removed unnecessary use() of Errno from SharedFileOpen.pm.  It is use()'d
      by the test suite, though, so left it as a pre-requisite in Makefile.PL,
      and added other modules use()'d by the test suite too.

    - Minor cosmetic changes.
_________________

v3.12 30 Apr 2003

    - Removed unused "len" argument from constant() function and simplified
      INPUT section of _constant() XS function to use the typemap for "const
      char *".

    - Removed unnecessary "fh" declarations from OUTPUT sections of _fsopen()
      and _sopen() XS functions.

    - Added AUTHOR option to Makefile.PL.  This is used when creating a PPD file
      (nmake ppd).
_________________

v3.11 08 Mar 2003

    - Fix for building under Perl 5.6.0: added definitions of IoTYPE_*
      constants.  This module *really* should build under Perl 5.6.0 and above
      now :-)

    - Changed generation of in-line subroutines for autoloaded constants to use
      typeglob assignment rather than eval().  The eval() gave us named, rather
      than anonymous, subroutines, but these subroutines are so simple that
      there is no advantage in them being named, and the typeglob method is
      faster.

    - Changed the typemap for "const char *" from the default T_PV (which uses
      SvPV_nolen() for INPUT) to a custom T_PV_len (which uses SvPV() for
      INPUT).  This avoids occasional bizarre problems which I can't reproduce.

    - Removed WHAT'S NEW section from POD, since there is not currently anything
      of note that is very new, and moved the sections on "Filehandles and
      Indirect Filehandles" and "Error Checking" to a "BACKGROUND REFERENCE"
      section near the end of the POD where they belong.
_________________

v3.10 25 Jan 2003

    - Fixes for building under Perls with PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT and/or
      PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS enabled (e.g. ActivePerl):

      * Added missing pTHX/aTHX macros to debug() function definition/calls to
        fix building under Perls with PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT enabled;

      * Added definitions of PerlIO and PerlIO_importFILE() to fix building with
        Perl 5.6.x's with PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS enabled;

      * Changed fclose() and close() calls to PerlSIO_fclose() and
        PerlLIO_close() calls respectively to fix building with Perl 5.8.0's
        with PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS enabled.

      This module should now build cleanly with Perl 5.6.0, 5.6.1 and 5.8.0 with
      any combination of PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT and PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS enabled or
      disabled.

    - Fixed the remaining fsopen() bug regarding text/binary modes under Perl
      5.8.0 by always setting the C file stream to binary mode before importing
      it into PerlIO, and then pushing a text mode layer on top if required.

    - Speeded up the "12_variables.t" test by reducing the retry times.
_________________

v3.00 02 Nov 2002

    - Fixed the fsopen() bug by opening the Perl filehandle in the XS rather
      than passing a file descriptor back from the XS to the Perl and
      effectively fdopen()'ing that.  Similarly re-coded sopen()'s XS.

    - Restricted the $Debug variable to only allow non-negative integer values
      like the other global variables.  The value 0 means off, 1 produces the
      same debug as previous versions of this module, and 2 produces additional
      information in the event of a failure revealing exactly what failed.

    - Added and improved some tests.
_________________

v2.12 05 Sep 2002

    - Fixes for Perl Version 5.8.0:

      * Explicitly quoted Win32::WinError in Makefile.PL otherwise it now dies
        with an error about 'Bareword not allowed while "strict subs" in use';

      * Explicitly put fdopen()'d Perl filehandle into binary mode because it no
        longer inherits this mode from the C filehandle opened in the XS.

    - Removed use() of AutoLoader since no use was being made of it.

    - Improved definition of @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS.

    - Corrected documentation typos in the README and the POD.
_________________

v2.11 02 Jul 2002

    - Imported the INFINITE flag from <winbase.h> like other Win32 modules do,
      rather than defining our own constant, to avoid clashes with them.

    - Added $Max_Time as a better means than $Max_Tries of controlling when to
      give up retrying when a file can't be opened due to a sharing violation.

    - Allowed the tie()'d variables to have the undefined value: this is
      necessary because local()'ising a tie()'d variable currently leaves it
      tie()'d but initially undefined.  It is also useful anyway to indicate the
      variable is not in use.

    - Updated documentation for these changes.
_________________

v2.10 20 Jun 2002

    - Implemented the "First-Class Filehandle Trick" in the function new_fh(),
      and re-exported the function gensym() from the Symbol module, for
      convenience.

    - Added $Max_Tries, $Retry_Timeout and INFINITE so that the file open can be
      retried if it failed due to a sharing violation.

    - Updated documentation for these changes.

    - Local()'ised the changes made to $! within AUTOLOAD() as per Perl Bug ID
      20020614.002: see http://bugs.perl.org/ for more details.
_________________

v2.00 27 May 2002

    - Changed arguments and return values of fsopen() and sopen() to require a
      "filehandle" argument and simply return a boolean, rather than returning
      the filehandle opened.

    - Updated documentation to reflect the changes made to fsopen() and sopen()
      and to document a serious flaw in fsopen() :-(

    - Minor cosmetic changes.
