Revision history for Perl extension Win32::SharedFileOpen.
_________________

v2.10 20 Jun 2002

	- Implemented the "First-Class Filehandle Trick" in the function new_fh(),
	  and re-exported the function gensym() from the Symbol module, for
	  convenience.

	- Added $Max_Tries, $Retry_Timeout and INFINITE so that the file open can be
	  retried if it failed due to a sharing violation.

	- Updated documentation for these changes.

	- Localised the changes made to $! within AUTOLOAD() as per Perl Bug ID
	  20020614.002: see http://bugs.perl.org/ for more details.
_________________

v2.00 27 May 2002

	- Changed arguments and return values of fsopen() and sopen() to require a
	  "filehandle" argument and simply return a boolean, rather than returning
	  the filehandle opened.

	- Updated documentation to reflect the changes made to fsopen() and sopen()
	  and to document a serious flaw in fsopen() :-(

	- Minor cosmetic changes.
