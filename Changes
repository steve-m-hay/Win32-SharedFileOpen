                      Win32::SharedFileOpen, Version 3.31
________________________________________________________________________________

Revision history for Perl extension Win32::SharedFileOpen.
_________________

v3.31 12 Dec 2004

    - Moved XSLoader::load() call inside BEGIN subroutine as recommended by the
      XSLoader manpage.  This means that the XSUB's are now installed before the
      rest of the Perl module is compiled, and hence their prototypes are now
      known, and can be checked, during the remaining compilation.
_________________

v3.30 31 Oct 2004

    - Removed $Debug variable and introduced new $ErrStr variable.

      Instead of callers having no clue as to why a function failed unless an
      error happens to be in $! and/or $^E or they had $Debug set to a true
      value, they can now inspect the $ErrStr variable to obtain the reason for
      the failure, much like the use of $! and $^E themselves, except that
      $ErrStr will always be set when a function fails, even if the last error
      did not relate to a system call or Win32 API call.

      Note that $! and/or $^E will continue to be set as well wherever they were
      previously being set, so existing code that inspects those variables will
      not be affected.  Callers should simply consider inspecting $ErrStr
      instead in the future.

      The only backwards compatibility issue here is the removal of the $Debug
      variable, which is unlikely to affect most production systems.

    - Updated documentation and tests for these changes.

    - Renamed some functions and macros in the XS and C code to use names that
      are more likely to be unique to this code, namely Win32SharedFileOpen_*()
      for functions and WIN32_SHAREDFILEOPEN_* for macros.

    - Introduced use of *MY_CXT* macros etc for handling static data in the C
      code to make the module thread-safe.

    - Reinstated ppport.h to provide *MY_CXT* macros etc for Perls older than
      5.7.3 (or 5.9.2 in the case of MY_CXT_CLONE).

    - Updated Module::Install and ExtUtils::AutoInstall components from versions
      0.36 and 0.61 of those distributions respectively.
_________________

v3.19 08 Aug 2004

    - Added a note to the INSTALL file that if possible the same compiler should
      be used to build this module as was used to build Perl itself.

      This module does not function correctly when built using the free Visual
      C++ Toolkit 2003 compiler in conjunction with a Perl (e.g. ActivePerl
      Build 810) that was built using Visual C++ 6.0.  (Passing CRT resources
      between the msvcr71.dll and msvcrt.dll C runtime libraries used by those
      compilers respectively doesn't work.)
_________________

v3.18 01 Aug 2004

    - Removed standard modules from the list of pre-requisites in Makefile.PL
      (since a minimum required Perl version is given anyway), and included
      ExtUtils::AutoInstall for auto-installing the remainder if necessary.

    - Updated Module::Install components from version 0.35 of that distribution
      and changed Makefile.PL to use abstract_from() now that it is fixed.

    - Changed INSTALL document and Makefile.PL to remove requirement for
      Microsoft Visual C++, and mention dmake.

    - Fixes for building under MinGW:

      * Added declarations of O_RAW and _fsopen() which are missing from some
        versions of MinGW.

      * Changed a "#else if" to the more correct "#elif" since GCC doesn't
        tolerate the former like VC++ does.

      This module should now build cleanly with Perls built using MinGW / dmake.

    - Improved warning and error messages to include the message string for the
      relevant standard C library errno or Win32 API last-error code where
      appropriate.

    - Changed return values from the private _fsopen() and _sopen() XSUB's so
      that if they fail when called in list context then they return an empty
      list rather than a single "false" value (which would be seen as "true" in
      list context).  (They are not currently called in list context anyway;
      this is just defensive programming.)
_________________

v3.17 26 Feb 2004

    - Use Module::Install as a front-end to ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  The same build
      script can also be used as a front-end to Module::Build in due course
      (once problems building XS modules with Module::Build are ironed out), and
      it also creates a META.yml file that contains a "license" key which
      http://search.cpan.org/ makes use of.

    - Added new test to check for POD errors if Test::Pod is available.
_________________

v3.16 21 Feb 2004

    - Separated the two debug modes into a more traditional Boolean debug mode
      emitting warnings about function failures, plus a new Boolean trace mode
      which emits the information regarding what fsopen() and sopen() did.

      This is a change in behaviour, but should only affect users investigating
      errors; it should not affect any production systems.

    - Clarified licence and warranty for the module, and included relevant
      licence files in the distribution.

    - Moved installation instructions to a separate INSTALL file.

    - Added PREOP to the dist option in Makefile.PL to ensure permissions are
      set correctly within the distdir (since they often aren't set correctly in
      the top-level directory when working on Windows) to stop CPANTS from
      complaining about bad permissions.

    - Added COMPRESS (and SUFFIX) and ZIPFLAGS to the dist option in Makefile.PL
      to enable "best compression" for gzip when running "nmake dist" and for
      zip when running "nmake zipdist" respectively.

    - Added clean option to Makefile.PL to have the const-c.inc and const-xs.inc
      files deleted by "nmake clean".

    - Added MANIFEST.SKIP to stop "nmake distcheck" from producing bogus
      warnings.

    - Moved SharedFileOpen.pm into lib/Win32/ sub-directory within distribution.
      This is the new layout style produced by h2xs as of version 1.23.

    - Removed ppport.h since no use was being made of it.  (This module contains
      its own portability fixups in order to build on Perl installations back to
      5.6.0, both with and without ithreads.)
_________________

v3.15 24 Sep 2003

    - Changed the output of debug information to use warn() rather than simply
      print()'ing to STDERR to enable the information to be captured by a
      $SIG{__WARN__} handler if required.

    - Added two tests to exercise the debug output with $Debug to set 2.

    - Renamed some functions in the XS and C code.

    - Reverted the typemap for "const char *" back to the default T_PV.  There
      didn't seem to be any point in the custom typemap.

    - Changed tabs to spaces (via "expand -t 4 infile > outfile") to avoid
      irritation when switching between editors that use 4- or 8-space tabs.

    - Changed control-E to caret-E in extended OS error variable name to make
      files "eight bit clean".

    - Updated META.yml via ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.17.
_________________

v3.14 31 Jul 2003

    - Preload some ERROR_* constants that our use()'rs might need otherwise the
      value of $^E gets interfered with when they are autoloaded by
      Win32::WinError in libwin32-0.191 and earlier when using debug builds of
      Perl.

    - Added META.yml (courtesy of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.11).
_________________

v3.13 28 May 2003

    - Regenerated constant() and AUTOLOAD() using h2xs 1.22 with options:
      -n Win32::SharedFileOpen -b 5.6.0
      to change to new constant loading system.

    - Added new constant, O_RAW, which is an alias for O_BINARY.

    - Removed unnecessary use() of Errno from SharedFileOpen.pm.  It is use()'d
      by the test suite, though, so left it as a pre-requisite in Makefile.PL,
      and added other modules use()'d by the test suite too.

    - Minor cosmetic changes.
_________________

v3.12 30 Apr 2003

    - Removed unused "len" argument from constant() function and simplified
      INPUT section of _constant() XS function to use the typemap for "const
      char *".

    - Removed unnecessary "fh" declarations from OUTPUT sections of _fsopen()
      and _sopen() XS functions.

    - Added AUTHOR option to Makefile.PL.  This is used when creating a PPD file
      (nmake ppd).
_________________

v3.11 08 Mar 2003

    - Fix for building under Perl 5.6.0: added definitions of IoTYPE_*
      constants.  This module *really* should build under Perl 5.6.0 and above
      now :-)

    - Changed generation of in-line subroutines for autoloaded constants to use
      typeglob assignment rather than eval().  The eval() gave us named, rather
      than anonymous, subroutines, but these subroutines are so simple that
      there is no advantage in them being named, and the typeglob method is
      faster.

    - Changed the typemap for "const char *" from the default T_PV (which uses
      SvPV_nolen() for INPUT) to a custom T_PV_len (which uses SvPV() for
      INPUT).  This avoids occasional bizarre problems which I can't reproduce.

    - Removed WHAT'S NEW section from POD, since there is not currently anything
      of note that is very new, and moved the sections on "Filehandles and
      Indirect Filehandles" and "Error Checking" to a "BACKGROUND REFERENCE"
      section near the end of the POD where they belong.
_________________

v3.10 25 Jan 2003

    - Fixes for building under Perls with PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT and/or
      PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS enabled (e.g. ActivePerl):

      * Added missing pTHX/aTHX macros to debug() function definition/calls to
        fix building under Perls with PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT enabled;

      * Added definitions of PerlIO and PerlIO_importFILE() to fix building with
        Perl 5.6.x's with PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS enabled;

      * Changed fclose() and close() calls to PerlSIO_fclose() and
        PerlLIO_close() calls respectively to fix building with Perl 5.8.0's
        with PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS enabled.

      This module should now build cleanly with Perl 5.6.0, 5.6.1 and 5.8.0 with
      any combination of PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT and PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS enabled or
      disabled.

    - Fixed the remaining fsopen() bug regarding text/binary modes under Perl
      5.8.0 by always setting the C file stream to binary mode before importing
      it into PerlIO, and then pushing a text mode layer on top if required.

    - Speeded up the "12_variables.t" test by reducing the retry times.
_________________

v3.00 02 Nov 2002

    - Fixed the fsopen() bug by opening the Perl filehandle in the XS rather
      than passing a file descriptor back from the XS to the Perl and
      effectively fdopen()'ing that.  Similarly re-coded sopen()'s XS.

    - Restricted the $Debug variable to only allow non-negative integer values
      like the other global variables.  The value 0 means off, 1 produces the
      same debug as previous versions of this module, and 2 produces additional
      information in the event of a failure revealing exactly what failed.

    - Added and improved some tests.
_________________

v2.12 05 Sep 2002

    - Fixes for Perl Version 5.8.0:

      * Explicitly quoted Win32::WinError in Makefile.PL otherwise it now dies
        with an error about 'Bareword not allowed while "strict subs" in use';

      * Explicitly put fdopen()'d Perl filehandle into binary mode because it no
        longer inherits this mode from the C filehandle opened in the XS.

    - Removed use() of AutoLoader since no use was being made of it.

    - Improved definition of @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS.

    - Corrected documentation typos in the README and the POD.
_________________

v2.11 02 Jul 2002

    - Imported the INFINITE flag from <winbase.h> like other Win32 modules do,
      rather than defining our own constant, to avoid clashes with them.

    - Added $Max_Time as a better means than $Max_Tries of controlling when to
      give up retrying when a file can't be opened due to a sharing violation.

    - Allowed the tie()'d variables to have the undefined value: this is
      necessary because local()'ising a tie()'d variable currently leaves it
      tie()'d but initially undefined.  It is also useful anyway to indicate the
      variable is not in use.

    - Updated documentation for these changes.
_________________

v2.10 20 Jun 2002

    - Implemented the "First-Class Filehandle Trick" in the function new_fh(),
      and re-exported the function gensym() from the Symbol module, for
      convenience.

    - Added $Max_Tries, $Retry_Timeout and INFINITE so that the file open can be
      retried if it failed due to a sharing violation.

    - Updated documentation for these changes.

    - Local()'ised the changes made to $! within AUTOLOAD() as per Perl Bug ID
      20020614.002: see http://bugs.perl.org/ for more details.
_________________

v2.00 27 May 2002

    - Changed arguments and return values of fsopen() and sopen() to require a
      "filehandle" argument and simply return a boolean, rather than returning
      the filehandle opened.

    - Updated documentation to reflect the changes made to fsopen() and sopen()
      and to document a serious flaw in fsopen() :-(

    - Minor cosmetic changes.
_________________

v1.00 13 Aug 2001

    - First released version.
_________________

v0.01 02 Jun 2001

    - Original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options:
      -n Win32::SharedFileOpen
