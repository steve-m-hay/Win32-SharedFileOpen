
Win32::SharedFileOpen Version 2.10
==================================

NAME

Win32::SharedFileOpen - Open a file for shared reading and/or writing

SYNOPSIS

	# Read and write files a la open(), but with mandatory file locking:
	# ------------------------------------------------------------------

	use Win32::SharedFileOpen;

	fsopen(FH1, 'readme', 'r', SH_DENYWR) or
			die "Can't read 'readme' and take write-lock: $^E\n";

	fsopen(FH2, 'writeme', 'w', SH_DENYRW) or
			die "Can't write 'writeme' and take read/write-lock: $^E\n";

	# Read and write files a la sysopen(), but with mandatory file locking:
	# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

	use Win32::SharedFileOpen;

	sopen(FH1, 'readme', O_RDONLY, SH_DENYWR) or
			die "Can't read 'readme' and take write-lock: $^E\n";

	sopen(FH2, 'writeme', O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, SH_DENYRW, S_IWRITE) or
			die "Can't write 'writeme' and take read/write-lock: $^E\n";

	# Retry opening the file if it fails due to a sharing violation:
	# --------------------------------------------------------------

	use Win32::SharedFileOpen qw(:DEFAULT :retry);

	$Max_Tries     = 10;	# Try opening the file upto 10 times
	$Retry_Timeout = 500;	# Wait 500 milliseconds between each try

	sopen(FH, 'readme', 'r', SH_DENYNO) or
		die "Can't read 'readme' after $Max_Tries tries: $^E\n";

	# Use a lexical indirect filehandle that closes itself when destroyed:
	# --------------------------------------------------------------------

	use Win32::SharedFileOpen qw(:DEFAULT new_fh);

	{
		my $fh = new_fh();

		sopen($fh, 'readme', 'r', SH_DENYNO) or
			die "Can't read 'readme': $^E\n";

		while (<$fh>) {
			# ... Do some stuff ...
		}

	}	# ... $fh is automatically closed here

WARNING

	*************************************************************************
	* The fsopen() function in this module currently has a bug which causes *
	* it to waste a filehandle every time it is called. Until this issue is *
	* resolved, the sopen() function should generally be used instead.      *
	* See the file WARNING-FSOPEN.TXT for more details.                     *

WHAT'S NEW

New features introduced since version 2.00 of this module:

	- A new function, new_fh(), has been added for generating anonymous
	  typeglobs for use as indirect filehandles. The gensym() function from the
	  Symbol module is also made available for this purpose.

	- Two new variables, $Max_Tries and $Retry_Timeout, have been added to
	  specify how many times and at what frequency fsopen() and sopen() should
	  automatically retry opening a file if it can't be opened due to a sharing
	  violation. (The default setting is to try only once.)

	- A new constant, INFINITE, has also been added. This can be assigned to
	  $Max_Tries to indicate that such retries should continue ad infinitum if
	  necessary.

COMPATIBILITY

Prior to version 2.00 of this module, fsopen() and sopen() both created a
filehandle and returned it to the caller. (undef was returned instead on
failure.)

As of version 2.00 of this module, the arguments and return values of these two
functions now more closely resemble those of the Perl built-in functions open()
and sysopen(). Specifically, they now both expect a filehandle as their first
argument and they both return a boolean value to indicate success or failure.

THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE. EXISTING SOFTWARE THAT USES THESE FUNCTIONS WILL
NEED TO BE MODIFIED.

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface to the Microsoft Visual C functions
_fsopen() and _sopen(). These functions are counterparts to the standard C
library functions fopen(3) and open(2) respectively (which are already
effectively available in Perl as open() and sysopen() respectively), but are
intended for use when opening a file for subsequent shared reading and/or
writing.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	nmake
	nmake test
	nmake install

Note that tests 510-513 in "10_fsopen_fh_leak.t" currently fail, as described in
the warning above.

DEPENDENCIES

The only non-standard module required by this module is Win32::WinError. This is
part of the "libwin32" bundle, which is almost invariably present in Perl
installations on Microsoft Windows platforms anyway, and is available from CPAN
at the URL http://www.perl.com/CPAN/.

Obviously this module only works on Microsoft Windows platforms, and requires
Microsoft Visual C to build it since other C build environments (e.g.
Cygwin/GCC) do not implement the Microsoft-specific functions which this module
provides wrappers to.
