
Win32::SharedFileOpen Version 1.00
==================================

NAME

Win32::SharedFileOpen - Open a file for shared reading and/or writing

SYNOPSIS

	use Win32::SharedFileOpen;

	my $file = 'C:\\Path\\To\\file.txt';

	# Open a file with write-locking a la C fopen() / Perl open().
	my $fh = fsopen($file, "r", SH_DENYWR) or
			die "Cannot read '$file' and take write-lock: $!\n";

	# or open a file with write-locking a la C open() / Perl sysopen().
	my $fh = sopen($file, O_RDONLY, SH_DENYWR) or
			die "Cannot read '$file' and take write-lock: $!\n";

	# ... Do some stuff ...

	close $fh;

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface to the Microsoft Visual C functions
_fsopen() and _sopen(). These functions are counterparts to the standard C
library functions fopen(3) and open(2) respectively (which are already
effectively available in Perl as open() and sysopen() respectively), but are
intended for use when opening a file for subsequent shared reading and/or
writing.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test
   nmake install

DEPENDENCIES

No non-standard modules are required by this module, but obviously it only runs
on Microsoft platforms and requires Microsoft Visual C to build it since other C
build environments (e.g. Cygwin/GCC) do not provide the Microsoft-specific
functions wrapped by this module.
